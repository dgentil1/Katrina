Here is where all the code will live :D

Diego: Read the dofile called main.do. You will see that there is explained all the structure of the folders, dofiles and programs. There is also an "special thing" that is the "silent" local variable, it is useful to run the code silently (as if it had the command 'quietly'). If you don't catch it we can always explain it to you in the next Skype call. We hope you like it :)

They still have to be revised. We miss:
- Comment almost all the dofiles
- Write tons of "display" commands to create a nice stata output that tells the user what the program is currently doing
- Rearrange the dofiles that have more than one program inside (we will ask joan tomorrow how to "transport" local among different dofiles and programs)
