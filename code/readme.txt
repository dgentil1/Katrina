Here is where all the code will live :D

Read the dofile called main.do. You will see that there is explained all the structure of the folders, dofiles and programs.

They still have to be revised. We miss:
- Comment almost all the dofiles
- Write tons of "display" commands to create a nice stata output that tells the user what the program is currently doing
- Rearrange the dofiles that have more than one program inside (we will ask joan tomorrow how to "transport" local among different dofiles and programs)


I HAVE ERASED THE SILENT STUFF!
